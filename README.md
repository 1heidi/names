# Analyzing Naming Conventions in Life Science Data Resources to Improve Findability for Humans and Machines

### Purpose: Analysis of full and common names predicted in the Global Biodata Coalition Inventory (2022)
  * Started with inventory:
      * Imker, H., Schackart, K., Istrate, A.-M., & Cook, C. E. (2023). Biodata Resource Inventory Dataset [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10105948
  * Filtered to resources with both a common and a full name predicted and names validated (names_input.csv)
  * Analysed for character/word count (STEP 1 and STEP 2 Scripts)
  * Common names were coded for optics and compared in an agreement matrix (STEP 3 Script)
